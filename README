Provides script(s) for playing internet radio streams through mplayer or any
other media player. By default, it uses mplayer, but this can be changed by
editing the PLAYER and PLAYER_ARGS in the bash script.

Feel free to add new streams and send me a pull-request so I can add them
to the collection.
